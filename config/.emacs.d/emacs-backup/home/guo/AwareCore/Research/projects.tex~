# PSG Sleep Stage
Skills: Linux, Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Machine Learning
Project Description:
Sleep staging is a fundamental but time consuming process in any sleep laboratory. To greatly speed up sleep staging
without compromising accuracy, we can develeop a framework for performing real-time automatic sleep stage
classification based on deep learning / machine learning algorithms.
